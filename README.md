# Unemployment Futures: Predicting Tomorrow's Job Market with AI

Project Overview:
This project leverages machine learning to forecast future unemployment rates based on historical data. We focus on clear, concise, and efficient code to provide accurate predictions of unemployment trends.

Key Features:
Historical Data: Uses past unemployment rates to build a predictive model.

Linear Regression: Trains a simple linear regression model to forecast future unemployment rates.

Future Prediction: Provides predictions for the years 2025, 2030, and 2035.

Visualization: Plots historical and predicted unemployment rates for clear visual analysis.

Explanation:
Historical Data: The model is trained on historical unemployment data to capture past trends.

Linear Regression: A linear regression model is used to predict future unemployment rates based on historical data.

Future Prediction: The model predicts unemployment rates for the future years 2025, 2030, and 2035.

Visualization: The plot shows both historical and predicted unemployment rates, providing a clear visual representation of the forecast.
